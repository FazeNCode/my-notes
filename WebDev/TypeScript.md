<h2> What is TypeScript: </h2>
Itâ€™s a superset of JavaScript, developed by Microsoft.
Compiles to plain JavaScript.
Browsers normally don't know how to run TypeScript code,  so that means you need a compiler to compile it down to it's original language 'JavaScript'
tsconfig.json file is used to configure how TypeScript Works

PROS:
------
More Robust 
Easily Spot Bugs
Predictability 
Readability

Cons:
-----
More Code To Write
More To learn 
Required Compilation 	
Not True Static Typing



Commands:
--------

Compile the typescript to plain javascript
```
tsc filename  
```

Start watch mode
```
tsc --watch filename 
```

Create the tsconfig file
```
tsc --init 	
```

      REACT  (JSX) JavaScript-Syntax-Extension 
		is considered to be a framework like Angular or Vue, 
		but it lacks built in functionality. To add functions in react
	You download packages for example, Npm to create.  Npx to execute

	
		
-VARIABLES-, var,  let,  const 



-DATA TYPES- Strings, Characters, Boleen, Null, Undefined, Symbols




-Concatenation-

console.log("My name is " + name +" and my age is" + age);


-Template Strings-
-----------------------
// console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old`);
//const info = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old`
// console.log(info);





-Methods-
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A method is a function that is associated with a object

console.log(f.length); 
A property doesn't use double parentheses 

console.log(f.toUpperCase());
A method must use double parentheses for it to work () A method is a function that is associated with a object

//console.log(f.substring(0,3));
Substring method is to count the number of strings in the character: Remember a method must be wrapped with double parenthesis.

//console.log(tech.split(' ,')) 
Split method is a type of an array, which you can add lists to
