SOFT-LINKS:		
ln -s /origin/path/file/or/folder softlink-name
To create the symlink

Key-Notes:
soft-links can be used on FILES and FOLDERS.
soft-links can be used on different file systems.
permissions to a soft-link do not matter, unlike hard-link

soft-links point to a path. Think of it as a shortcut, exactly how browsers are shortcuts, to the actual path.

File System E.G: xfs, xt2, xt3 ,xt4, ufs, exfat, ntfs
