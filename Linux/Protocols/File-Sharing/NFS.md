<h2> What is NFS? </h2>
<br>
Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that allows you to share directories and files with other Linux clients over a network.


Shared directories are typically created on a file server, running the NFS server component. Users add files to them, which are then shared with other users who have access to the folder.
