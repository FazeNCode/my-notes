In this example we are gonna take a look at how to add Hexa Decimal
When adding and subtracting hexadecimal, it's very important to note, the base is 16.

A = 10
B = 11
C = 12 
D = 13
E = 14
F = 15


<br>
As opposed to decimal numbers which is base of 10,
For example when adding decimal numbers, such as 29 + 19, we use a base of 10. Example of operation below.
<br>

  1
  29
+ 19
-----
  48
 
Like mentioned above we use a base of 16 when adding or subtracting hexadecimal 

  1   
  E F 8 6
+ 6 C 3 9
------------
     B B E
 

<br>
6 + 9 = 14  
14 in Hexadecimal is E 

<br>
8 + 3 = 11
11 in Hexadecimal is B

<br>
15   12
F  +  C  = 27 


<br>
There is no letter in hexadecimal that is 27, the highest letter in hexadecimal is 15 which is equal to F.
In this case we will take 27 and subtract it by the base of 16

27 - 16 = 11 
11 in hexadecimal is B

Next we need to carry the one on top of the E, You might ask why are we carrying a one on top of the E.
Well iniatlly we got 27, but we subtracted it by 16 which is the base in hexadecmial, and we did this because the highest letter in hexedecimal is 15 which is F, so in order for us to convey in hexadecimal.

Next is E + 6
which equals  = 20

Again we must subtract 20 with the base of 16, because the highest number in hexdecimal is 15 which is F

20 - 16 = 4

4 + 1 5
