In this example we are gonna take a look at how to add Hexa Decimal
When adding and subtracting hexadecimal, it's very important to note, the base is 16.

A = 10
B = 11
C = 12 
D = 13
E = 14
F = 15


<br>
As opposed to decimal numbers which is base of 10,
For example when adding decimal numbers, such as 29 + 19, we use a base of 10. Example of operation below.
<br>

  1
  29
+ 19
-----
  48
 
Like mentioned above we use a base of 16 when adding or subtracting hexadecimal 
     
  E F 8 6
+ 6 C 3 9
------------
      B E
 

<br>
6 + 9 = 14  
14 in Hexadecimal is E 

<br>
8 + 3 = 11
11 in Hexadecimal is B

<br>
15   12
F  +  C  = 27
