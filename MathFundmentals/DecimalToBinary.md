<h3> How to convert a Decimal number to a Binary </h3>

In order to convert the Decimal number to binary, we must divide the number by 2, and note down the remainder once it's divded. 
For example, to convert decimal number "25" we would divide by 2, which gives us 12.5. We then round down the number to 12 meaning we have 1 remainder. Next we divide "12" with 2 which gives us 6, here we do not have any remainding, so we can put a R=0

25/2 = 12.5    R=1
12/2 = 6       R=0
6/2 =  3       R=0
3/2 = 1.5      R=1
1/2 = 0.5      R=1
You have to divide the decimal number by 2 and establish whether there is a remainder or not. If there is a remainder you can put R=1.
NOTE: the binary number would be counted from bottom to top, for example, the below example would be 11001 in binary,
NOTE: Binary must be 4 bits in a pair, so for the example below we must add 3 0â€™s which would be 0001 1001
