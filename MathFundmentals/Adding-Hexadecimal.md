In this example we are gonna take a look at how to add Hexa Decimal
When adding and subtracting hexadecimal, it's very important to note, the base is 16.

A = 10
B = 11
C = 12 
D = 13
E = 14
F = 15


<br>
As opposed to decimal numbers which is base of 10,
For example when adding decimal numbers, such as 29 + 19, we use a base of 10. Example of operation below.
<br>

  1
  29
+ 19
-----
  48
 
Like mentioned above we use a base of 16 when adding or subtracting hexadecimal 

  1   
  E F 8 6
+ 6 C 3 9
------------
 1 5 B B E
 

<h1> Step 1 <h1>
<br>
6 + 9 = 14  
14 in Hexadecimal is E 

<h1> Step 2 <h1>
<br>
8 + 3 = 11
11 in Hexadecimal is B

<h1> Step 3 <h1>
<br>
15   12
F  +  C  = 27 
<br>
There is no letter in hexadecimal that is 27, the highest letter in hexadecimal is 15 which is equal to F.
In this case we will take 27 and subtract it by the base of 16

27 - 16 = 11 
11 in hexadecimal is B

<br>
Next we need to carry the one on top of, E. You might ask why are we carrying a one on top of the E.
Well iniatlly we got 27, but we subtracted it by 16, which again is the base in hexadecmial, and we did this because the highest letter in hexedecimal is F which is equal to 15.

<h1> Step 4 <h1>
E + 6  (++1) 
which equals  = 20


Now once again we have a number which does not exist in letter format in hexadecmial so we again will subtract it by the base of 16
NOTE: Highest number in hexadecimal is 15 which equates to F

20 - 16 = 4

Now do you remember the one we carried on top of E from Step 3, We can now add that +1 to our answer got 4 
4 + 1 = 5



<h1> Step 5 <h1>
Now all thats remaning is to add a 1 in front of the five. Now hold on, Why are we adding a 1 in front of the five, this makes no sense, you might be wondering.
Well If you take a look at step 4 the original answer we had gotten was 20, but there is no letter in hexadecimal that represents 20, so we subtracted it by the base of 16, now since we reduced the value to a hexadecimal letter, we have to carry a 1. 

And so there is nothing to add the 1 to, so thats why we put a 1 beside the 5 giving us
```
 1 5 B B E 
```
 as the answer
